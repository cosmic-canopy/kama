# kama roadmap

**The order of work, and nothing else.** One row per item: what it is, and a link to the reasoning in
[ROADMAP_DETAIL.md](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md). The language's **history** lives in the git log; what the language
**is** lives in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

> **Keep this file short.** No reasoning here — it goes in [ROADMAP_DETAIL.md](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md), whose
> header carries the full maintenance rule (where a shipped item's record goes, and what may stay behind).
> This file drifted to 1,279 lines once by absorbing that prose, at which point "what is next" stopped
> being answerable without reading all of it. `tools/check-roadmap.sh` holds the split down.

> ⚠️ **`KR-<n>` is a PERMANENT id, not a position.** It is assigned once, never reused, and never
> renumbered: a row keeps its id wherever it moves in the list, and a shipped row's id retires with it,
> leaving a gap. **A new row takes the id on the counter below, and bumps the counter in the same edit.**
> `tools/check-roadmap.sh` holds uniqueness and format down, and holds the counter above every id ever cited.
>
> **Why a counter, and not "one more than the highest id present".** The highest id PRESENT is not the highest
> id ever ISSUED: once a newer row ships and is deleted, its number looks free again. Two ids were nearly
> reissued that way, and on 2026-09-14 two machines each filed the same id for different rows. The counter is
> one line, so two concurrent issues edit the same line and the second rebase CONFLICTS — the collision is loud
> instead of two rows silently sharing a name.
>
> **Why, because the old scheme cost real work.** Rows used to be numbered by POSITION, so deleting a
> shipped row renumbered every row below it and silently re-pointed every `row N` written in prose
> anywhere — in this file, in the detail, in a commit message, in a note someone kept. It had already
> happened twice, and closing two rows in one sitting broke two more references. Position numbering also
> made "find the row by its TEXT, never its number" a standing instruction to every reader, which is a
> workaround for a numbering scheme rather than a property anyone wanted. **A `KR-` id is safe to cite.**

**Next id: KR-60**

## The shape

- **1.0 — language complete.** The surface is feature-complete; the tag is the API-stability point, so
  anything source-breaking lands before it or waits for 2.0.
- **1.x — systems & runtime.** Capabilities built ON the finished language: stdlib reach, serde back ends,
  MCU toolchain packaging, engine/GPU library work. Mostly library + codegen, little new syntax.
- **2.0 — dual-mode scripting** (flagship): the same language compiled OR scripted, via a shared IR feeding
  C, direct-wasm and a bytecode VM — [§7](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s7).
- **Concurrency** — the primitives are done ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md#concurrency-)); what is left is libraries on
  them, the job system and the event-loop scheduler — [§6](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s6).
- **Engine track** (product north star): a portable WebGPU game engine — a **separate product built on
  kama**, not part of it — [§8](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s8).

⚠️ **Performance invariant across all of the above:** kama is at C parity today, and the native/release tier
(`kama → C → clang/emcc`) stays exactly as fast — untouched. Multimodal is strictly additive.

---

## NOW — what is being worked on

**The priority list, in order.** Everything here is unblocked and fair game today.

**On the 1.0 tag:** it is the maintainer's call, not a checklist this file owns. This paragraph used to
say **explicit SIMD is the last source-visible gap** and must land before the tag. That row has now
**shipped in full** — the wasm `-msimd128` flag, the `Simd<T, comptime N>` type with shuffles, masks and
integer lanes, and the derived `SIMD128` flag ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md) *Explicit SIMD*; the measurements are
in [§2](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s2)) — and none of it was source-breaking. The language is complete and it
could be cut at any point; the current intent is to cut it once the stdlib rows below are done, so the
first stable release ships with the reach to match.

**The last source-breaking item has shipped.** Compile-time values left the generic list in `0.9.141`:
`<…>` holds types, `comptime(int32 N)` declares values, `#(4)` passes them ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md)
*Generics*). Everything remaining on this list is additive and can land in any 1.x, so the tag is no
longer waiting on a break — only on how much stdlib reach the maintainer wants in the first release.
Ordering the rows below is the maintainer's call.

**Size** is a batching hint, not a commitment: **S** fits beside others in one session · **M** is about a
session · **L** is several · **XL** wants its own design doc before any code. It is read off the linked
detail, so it is only as good as that reasoning: `?` marks a row the detail itself says is unprobed, and
**`—` means never scoped** — sizing work nobody has looked at would be invention, not estimation.

| id | item | size | detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| KR-51 | **`Handle` decodes malformed input as `Ok`** — its hand-written `deserialize` never checks the reader's failure flag. Fix it at the type (check `failed()`, return `Err`), not with a boundary safety net; unblocked now that `--no-heap` judges what is reached (`0.9.348`) | S | [§4](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s4) |
| KR-48 | **`kama_alloc`/`kama_free` are the only allocation primitives** — every raw `malloc`/`free` in emitted C (22 sites), the runtime headers, `kama_os.h` and the prelude's `GlobalAllocator` moves onto them, ending ~20 blocks allocated by one family and freed by another; `calloc`/`realloc` become helpers over the two; a guard keeps libc allocation in exactly one place. No behaviour change. Allocation campaign step 2 | M | [§5](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s5) |
| KR-49 | **A replaceable global allocator** — `kama_alloc`/`kama_free` delegate to a global allocator that defaults to `malloc`/`free` and that a program replaces (a declaration vs a weak link-time symbol is the one surface decision). `Shared.adopt`'s hard-coded control block and the `SortedMap` root move onto `A` in the same step. Allocation campaign step 3 | M | [§5](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s5) |
| KR-50 | **Allocator-aware errors** — boxing an error into `Owned<Error>` calls `malloc` directly instead of drawing from an allocator; route it (and primitive boxing) through the box's `A`, so a replaced global allocator covers every fallible API. Decide whether a PER-CALL error allocator (a contract change to serde) is wanted. Allocation campaign step 4 | M | [§5](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s5) |
| KR-58 | **The Windows OS seam allocates a wide path on every file-system call** — eleven `std::fs` externs (`kama_exists`, `kama_open_read`, `kama_mkdir`, `kama_rename`, …) convert their UTF-8 path to UTF-16 on the heap, so they are `@heap` on every target and a `--no-heap` program cannot touch a path anywhere, though POSIX allocates nothing there. Convert into a stack buffer (`MAX_PATH`, long-path fallback decided in the design) and drop the marks. Seven more are heap on one platform only (`kama_proc_spawn` on Windows, `kama_proc_detach` on POSIX, `args`/`programName`/`env` natively but not on wasm) and get the same question | M? | [§5](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s5) |
| KR-54 | **A declaration `@compileFor` drops is never checked** — it is pruned before collection, so neither the declaration walk nor emission sees it: `@compileFor(ARCH_WASM32) fn int32 f(Zork z)` builds clean on native, signature and body included. Code for a target not built daily rots silently, which is the portability promise failing quietly. Judging names before pruning is wrong (a target-only extern legitimately exists on one target only); the likely answer is analysis per declared target (`kama check` over every target in `kama.json`) — a design decision first. Found closing the name-resolution campaign (`0.9.340`) | M? | [§2](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s2) |
| KR-56 | **kama cannot bind a named C constant** — a C API's bit flags are `static const` values (`WGPUBufferUsage_Uniform`, `WGPUTextureUsage_RenderAttachment` in webgpu.h) or `#define`s, not enum constants, so `type extern enum` cannot name them and `examples/webgpu/triangle.kama` still spells three as numbers. The C-to-kama half of the same no-magic rule `type extern enum` applied to enums; wants a design pass (a `static const` and a `#define` differ in what kama can learn about them) with bytes before code | — | [§2](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s2) |
| KR-1 | **`std::time` calendar** — civil-from-days, ISO-8601 format/parse, no zone database; whole or not at all | — | [§1](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s1) |
| KR-2 | **No incremental build** — every build recompiles everything. ⚠️ Largely already answered and never rowed: `zig cc` has a content-addressed per-TU object cache (measured 4.13 s cold, **0.11 s after editing one file**), so a bundled install is incremental today and kama's own object cache is mostly moot. What is left is the SLIM install, which uses clang and has no cache | — | [§9](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s9) |
| KR-3 | **Job system / event-loop scheduler** — libraries on the shipped concurrency primitives; the pool is sized, **scheduling** is what is missing | ? | [§6](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s6) |
| KR-4 | **Modular / opt-in stdlib** — whether emit-on-instantiation + `--gc-sections` pruning scales, or explicit per-module opt-in / dead-function elimination is wanted before the stdlib grows | — | [§3](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s3) |
| KR-5 | **`std::io` transform adapters** — compression et al., composing with serde and net | — | [§1](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s1) |
| KR-6 | **`std::net`** — IPv6, UDP multicast | — | [§2](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s2) |
| KR-7 | **`std::process`** — live/streaming child-stream reads | — | [§1](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s1) |
| KR-8 | **Restricted-private contract members** — *to consider*, not scheduled: a contract may declare a member non-public, with a `friend` grant naming who may reach it, and an implementer then matches that visibility instead of being forced `public`. It is no longer a serde blocker — that justification was written before the container seam was measured, and the seam turned out to need no contract at all. What stands on its own is expressiveness: binding types together with a guarantee that is not part of the public surface. ⚠️ **`private` on a contract member is ACCEPTED AND INERT today** (measured `0.9.269`): it parses and the marker is silently dropped, so with a `public` implementer a call through a contract-typed value reaches it. That is the sibling `0.9.266` left behind when it refused `friend` on a contract on the premise that a contract *cannot* have a private member. Deliberately **not fixed** — it is inert, it blocks nothing, and whether it is refused or made real is this row's decision. Both spellings already parse, so the work is emitter-only | M | [§4](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s4) |
| KR-19 | **MCU toolchain packaging** — board presets, vendor-HAL glue, a real-hardware flash pass; AVR later | — | [§5](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s5) |
| KR-20 | **`csources` compiles C, not C++** — a `.cpp`/`.cc`/`.cxx`/`.mm` entry is refused BY NAME with the two obstacles: every input shares one flag prefix (`-std=c11` plus the C-only warning promotions), so a C++ TU needs its own, and a C++ link needs the target's C++ runtime library (`-lc++` vs `-lstdc++`), which varies per target and is a table kama does not have. A `.m` is a third case — Objective-C is one platform's language and `csources` is project-level with no per-target tier to exclude it, so this row carries per-target `csources` too. The first consumer drives C++ and a third-party cmake project from a Makefile; the cmake half is not ours, the C++ half is | M | [§2](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s2) |
| KR-21 | **Remaining language limitations** — no bound spells "an integer primitive", so `cast<T>` in a generic is checked per instantiation (the stdlib avoids it: pass by address, move `sizeof(T)` bytes); unresolved type names inside generic arguments ⚠️ (re-probed: the diagnostic is *"cannot tell which `DynamicArray` to construct — give the type arguments"* even when the turbofish IS written, so it advises the thing the author already did — still so at `0.9.317`, repro `kr21_3`); `@compileFor` is whole-declaration only, so it cannot gate a single method or one `implements` block (a gated member is refused cleanly, a same-named pair included); contract-refinement thunks; `Fixed<B,const F>` implementing `Real`; ⚠️ **`@align`/`@packed` on an `enum` is NOT a silent miss — re-probed 2026-09-10, it is a clean refusal** naming the reason and the fix (`type enum E : IntType`), so what is left here is only whether a tagged enum should honor a layout attribute at all; an `expose fn` with neither `@callerThread` nor `@foreignEntry` is not a region, so a host-called body reading a mutable static is unchecked (a source break for 11 in-tree files if required) | — | [§2](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s2) |
| KR-22 | **Collections knobs** — HashDoS-resistant keyed hashing; zero-size-field elision; thin smart-ptr handles | — | [§5](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s5) |
| KR-23 | **Performance** — bench cohort (add Zig), serialization benchmark track, devirtualization ladder, CPU-tuning knob | — | [§9](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s9) |
| KR-24 | **Hot-reload library** — `dlopen` + file-watch + fn-pointer rebind. Both compiler primitives already ship | — | [§8](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s8) |
| KR-25 | **Safe `std::gpu` binding wrapper** — wgpu handles→RAII `type resource`s (as `std::net` wraps sockets) + a typed acquire result naming `Occluded`; the seam's size accessor and discarded event queue. Scope: exactly the handles the seam already touches, nothing above them | M | [§8](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s8) |
| KR-26 | **`std::input`** — the seam pumps the window event queue and throws it away, on both targets: no keyboard, mouse, wheel, pointer-lock, resize, focus or gamepad. Peer of `std::gpu`, and the reason the first engine on kama derives its own window | M | [§8](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s8) |
| KR-39 | **`@noheap` cannot cross a contract slot even when the callee is knowable** — a `@noheap` caller cannot use serde at all: the refusal is `Deserializer.readI32`, a contract member not declared `@noheap`, so nothing about scalar reads is provable. Two answers, and the second is the better one. Declaring the scalar members `@noheap` is the shipped mechanism (every backend is then checked against it, and `readString`/`writeString` stay unmarked because they genuinely allocate) — but `serializeJsonBuffer` CONSTRUCTS its backend and boxes it, so the concrete implementation is statically known and the compiler could prove the callee and check that body directly, with nothing declared on the contract. That is the devirtualization ladder (the **Performance** row) reaching a real consumer | M | [§4](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s4) |
| KR-40 | **Binding comments** — documentation syntax that cannot drift from the declaration it references. Motivating case: a contract member with no caller in kama source (the compiler emits the call), where a reader asks "why is this here?" and a comment is the only answer — and comments are not binding. Wanted at the declaration, checked against what it names, so a rename or a removal is an error rather than silent rot. Unscoped: needs a design pass on what a binding comment may assert before any syntax is proposed | — | [§1](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s1) |
| KR-57 | **A binding may take the name of a function in scope** — SPEC says kama has no shadowing, but `fn int32 use(int32 helper) { return helper + helper(); }` builds and runs; with a bare PRELUDE function (`args`, `print`) the emitted C local shadows the C function and clang refuses what kama accepted. Refuse the binding like every other shadowing, not rename it in C | S? | [§2](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s2) |

## LATER — tooling & ecosystem

Most of this gates on the repo going public.

| id | item | detail |
|---|---|---|
| KR-27 | **Registry — hosted deployment (M3.3)** + mandatory verification and the trust model | [§10](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s10) |
| KR-28 | **Editor/registry registrations** — Zed extension registry, nvim-treesitter, linguist, Helix upstreaming, Marketplace publish | [§10](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s10) |
| KR-29 | **tree-sitter accepts 78 of the 84 reserved words as a binding name** — `Thing else = …` renders as a valid declaration in every editor on this grammar, and the compiler then rejects it. The two reserve differently by construction: `kama.l` consults one table at every identifier, tree-sitter extracts keywords CONTEXTUALLY and a binding site expects `$.identifier`. ⚠️ `check-treesitter.sh` cannot see this class, and the one fixture that looks like it covers it passes on its USE site, not its declaration | [§10](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s10) |
| KR-30 | **LSP residuals** — one build configuration per server process; the prelude-analysis floor per keystroke; ⚠️ **a receiver typed by a generic instance over an UNBOUND parameter resolves to nothing in completion** — `const ref Node<K>` inside another generic offers no members at all, PUBLIC ones included, while the same receiver spelled `Node<int32>` offers every one (measured `0.9.300`, writing the `friend`-across-generics fixtures; it is receiver resolution, not visibility) | [§10](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s10) |
| KR-31 | **`kama fmt`** — a native formatter. Substrate settled: use the compiler's own front end, **not** tree-sitter | [§10](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s10) |
| KR-32 | **Debugger value formatting** — render `string`/`Optional`/collections as kama values, not their emitted-C form | [§10](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s10) |
| KR-33 | **`kama query` residuals** — no `callers-of`/`implementors-of`, no stdin/unsaved-buffer mode | [§10](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s10) |

## FUTURE — the big arcs, in this order

The 2.0 work. Nothing here starts before the NOW list is done.

| id | item | detail |
|---|---|---|
| KR-34 | **Editor tooling** — the front end as a reusable query API; everything later rides on it | [§10](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s10) |
| KR-35 | **Scripting / multimodal — the flagship 2.0.** First step: refactor the C emitter behind an abstract backend interface | [§7](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s7) |
| KR-36 | **Self-hosting — the capstone, LOWEST priority.** A maturity milestone, not an enabler | [§7](ROADMAP_DETAIL.md#s7) |
