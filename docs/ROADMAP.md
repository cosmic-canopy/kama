# kama roadmap

The forward plan — near-term to long-term, read in sequence. The language's **history** lives in the git
log; what the language **is** lives in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md). This file is only *what's next*.

## The shape

- **1.0 — language complete.** The language surface is stable and the pre-1.0 work list is closed; **the
  last gate is the docs/naming reconcile** (§1) — you build *with* the language, not *on* it.
- **1.x — systems & runtime.** Capabilities built ON the finished language: deeper stdlib reach, more serde
  back ends, MCU toolchain packaging, engine/GPU library work. Mostly library + codegen, little new syntax.
- **2.0 — dual-mode scripting** (flagship): the *same* language usable compiled OR scripted, via a shared IR
  feeding C, direct-wasm, and a bytecode VM — the `kama` binary self-contained (§7).
- **Concurrency** — the language primitives are done ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md#concurrency-)); what is left is
  libraries on top of them — the job system and the event-loop scheduler (§8, web-framework readiness).
- **Engine track** (product north star): a portable lightweight **WebGPU** game engine, woven through 1.x — a
  product built *on* kama, not part of the language (§8).

## 1. Remaining before 1.0

What the language *is* lives in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md); the engine/MCU capability matrices in
[ENGINE_READINESS.md](ENGINE_READINESS.md) / [MCU_READINESS.md](MCU_READINESS.md); the history in the git log.

**The language surface is feature-complete.** What is left before the tag is the
docs/naming reconcile — 1.0 is the API-stability point, so naming and case conventions fix there
(PascalCase types, lowerCamel methods, no `I`-prefix on contracts, lowercase `string`), and anything that
would *break* source has to land first or wait for 2.0.

**At the tag itself — repoint the Zed grammar pin.** `editor/zed/extension.toml` pins a *commit*, and Zed
installs the grammar by fetching that rev — so the pin, not the working tree, is what Zed users get. It is
currently behind (the commit predates `slot` and named match patterns, so neither highlights for them).
Bump `rev` to the release tag when 1.0.0 is cut, and add the guard that cannot exist while it is a moving
SHA: assert the tag's `tree-sitter-kama/grammar.js` + `queries/` match the tree. Doing it at the tag is what
dissolves the chicken-and-egg — a content check against a *commit* pin would fail the very commit that
changes the grammar. `tools/check-editors.sh` §2c today proves only that the rev resolves and carries a
grammar, never that it is the current one.

Everything else here is library or toolchain work that does **not** gate the tag:

1. **`std::process` — async/Poller-driven *live* child-stream reads.** `run()` captures a finished child's
   output today; streaming a running child's stdout as it arrives is the piece left.
2. **Standard-library follow-ups — the M2 PARITY CAMPAIGN**, briefed in
   [design/stdlib-parity.md](design/stdlib-parity.md) (cold-start ready; delete that file when it ships).
   The bar is **Rust-`std` parity**: the only no-GC peer, and the only one whose stdlib also stops before
   regex/TLS/HTTP/crypto — which is the right line now that kama has a package manager. No new language
   surface; pure library/codegen. Split M2a (parse · sort · math completion · `char` classification) /
   M2b (fs + path · io handles + `lines()` · sleep + wall clock · DNS) / M2c (`std::random` ·
   `std::encoding`). The items below are that campaign's contents:
   - **`std::net`** — DNS/`getaddrinfo` (numeric hosts only today). *(UDP and ephemeral-port `getsockname`
     ship — `lib/std/net/udp.kama`; IPv6 and multicast are separate, tracked in §2.)*
   - **`std::fs` / `std::io`** — richer `Metadata` (mtime/perms), path helpers, `mkdir`/`rename`/`exists`,
     `OpenMode.Append`, stdin/stdout/stderr as `Reader`/`Writer` handles, `readLine`/`lines()`.
     *(Buffered readers/writers ship — `BufReader`/`BufWriter` in `lib/std/io/streams.kama`.)*
   - **`std::io` transform adapters (compression et al.)** — `Writer`/`Reader` *wrappers* that transform bytes
     in flight, composing with serde and net (Go/Rust `io`-wrapper style): `DeflateWriter<W>`/`InflateReader<R>`
     (gzip/deflate), later checksums/hashing/framing. On the **web target** these are a near-free ride — wrap
     the browser's built-in `CompressionStream`/`DecompressionStream` (no wasm code-size cost); on native, wrap
     zlib/zstd. Composes as `encodeTo(v, into: DeflateWriter(sink))`. The *transport* free-rides too
     (WebSocket `permessage-deflate`, HTTP `Content-Encoding`). Pairs naturally with the binary serde backend
     (crushes its field-name redundancy). (Engine-level replication — snapshots/deltas/dirty-tracking — stays
     above this, in the engine.)
   - **⚠️ Windows CI is RED, and must be green + required before the tag.** The `windows-latest` leg last
     reported **779 passed, 48 failed** (2026-08-01, MSYS2/UCRT64). It is still best-effort, so those
     failures do not block a merge — which is how a red leg stayed invisible. Two pieces:
     - **Triage the 48.** Only one was captured in the log tail, and it was a *harness* bug, not a compiler
       one: `check-target` asserted the `--shared` output name by grepping the stubbed `--cc echo` command
       line, which a natively-built Windows kama emits through `cmd.exe` — whose `echo` keeps the quotes
       that POSIX `sh` strips, so `-o "…/arith.dll"` failed an anchored `arith\.dll$` match while the build
       itself was correct. **Fixed** (`tr -d '"'` in `tools/check-target.sh`). The other 47 need the full
       CI log — the excerpt on hand stops after the first failing guard.
     - **The Windows suite takes 1496 s vs ~75 s in the container**, and every `net_*` fixture costs ~30 s
       (`net_refused` 30.7 s, `net_nonblocking_connect` 30.2 s). That is the shape of a connect/accept
       timeout being waited out rather than a test running, so it is likely one root cause across a dozen
       fixtures, not a dozen bugs.
     Promote to **required** once green, so a Windows regression blocks a merge.
3. **MCU toolchain packaging — polish.** The turnkey Cortex-M path ships and is QEMU-proven
   ([mcu.md](mcu.md)). What is left: more board presets (STM32/Pico), vendor-HAL glue, and a real-hardware
   flash pass — detail in §5 (embedded "Toolchain / build" row).

**Post-1.0 — the decided big-arc sequence (with the user, 2026-07-26):**
1. **Editor tooling (§10).** The front end is a reusable query API with real source spans, which every
   later tool rides on; the residuals are in §10.
2. **Scripting / multimodal (§7) — the flagship 2.0.** The polymorphic-emitter → direct-wasm → bytecode-VM arc,
   driven by wanting a fast iteration/runtime tier for game engines + web. First concrete step: refactor the C
   emitter behind an abstract backend interface (C as the first impl), the shared lowering in the base.
3. **Self-hosting — the final-version capstone, LOWEST priority.** A maturity/dogfooding milestone, **not** an
   enabler: it rides on #1 (front-end-as-library) + #2 (runtime-into-kama), which is why §7 notes the
   runtime port makes multi-backend and self-hosting *the same project*. Do it last, when the language is stable.

**⚠️ Non-negotiable performance invariant (across all of the above).** kama is at **C parity today**, and the
**native/release tier (`kama → C → clang/emcc`) stays exactly as fast + lean — untouched.** Multimodal is
**strictly additive**: the same kama syntax *also* renders to direct-WASM and (later) a scripting VM as **separate
iteration tiers**, never a replacement for the C backend. Direct-WASM is "another hot-reload/scripting option" —
near-native and toolchain-free, but **not** as fast as native kama today (LLVM's optimizer + SIMD autovectorization
keep `C→emcc -O3` ahead on heavy numeric loops), so the **release tier remains the max-performance path for both
native and web**. Don't conflate "can emit WASM directly" with "the fast web path."

## 2. Deferred language bits (tracked)

Policy: **no known limitation stays untracked** — each is scheduled or a declared non-goal. The
language-completeness residual is **closed**; what remains here is genuinely later-track or opt-in.

- **The unsafe seam — `Ptr<T>` -> `UnsafePtr<T>`, and no `null` in safe kama.** Its own campaign, agreed
  while the `slot` work was in flight (which is where its customers came from: eight buffer-realloc sites
  now carry `= null` field initializers). Shape: rename the raw pointer to say what it is; an
  `unsafe UnsafePtr<T> p = null;` field-declaration modifier; `Optional`-returning FFI wrappers;
  `unsafe { }` around the teardown guards; then ban the `null` token outside `unsafe`. Plus a
  compiler-emitted debug null trap at the two `_inUnsafe` deref gates. `lib/std/ptr/` is its natural home.
  **Source-breaking**, so before the tag or 2.0.

- **A lib/prelude diagnostic is attributed to the file being checked.** `kama check app.kama` reports an
  error raised inside `lib/std/…` or the prelude as `app.kama:<the LIB file's line>` — the line number is
  right for the wrong file, so it points into the middle of the user's source or past its end. Harmless for
  a single error a human reads in context, and actively misleading in an editor or any sweep over the
  corpus (enumerating rule violations across `tests/` had to filter by "is the reported line past this
  file's end?" to tell the two apart). Wants the unit to travel with the diagnostic, as `RefUnitScope`
  already does for the reference index.
- **Contract refinement — one under-tested edge (clean workaround).** `type contract Child … implements
  Parent` works for dispatch, but was exercised mainly with scalar-param parents. Remaining: a concrete type
  implementing the child gets **no parent-contract conformance thunk** — pass it where the parent is expected
  only if it *also* spells `implements Parent` — and a child-contract-**value** → parent-contract-param upcast
  is unsupported (dispatch *through* the child to inherited methods works). Trivial workaround, used in
  `lib/std/net/stream.kama`; the fix is to auto-emit parent thunks for refining-contract implementers.
  *(The generic-instance param edge is fixed — an inherited slot's signature is now rebound to its
  parent-resolved absolute spelling in `linkContracts`; fixture `tests/contract_refine_generic.d`.)*
- **Unicode module (post-1.0).** The shipped `string` core is UTF-8 bytes + `.chars()` codepoints with
  **ASCII** casing/whitespace; a later module adds Unicode-correct casing + whitespace, and an eager
  `DynamicArray<string>` collect for `split` (the lazy `Split` iterator ships today).
  **Grapheme-cluster segmentation belongs here too.** `substring` traps on a split *codepoint* and
  `floorCharBoundary`/`truncate` snap to one (SPEC § *Strings*), which guarantees valid UTF-8 but **not**
  visually intact text — a boundary cut can still split an `e` + combining accent, an emoji ZWJ sequence
  or a flag. Cluster boundaries are defined by UAX #29 and need the `Grapheme_Cluster_Break` property per
  codepoint, i.e. a data table — not a bit trick. A cheap partial version (range-checking the combining
  diacriticals) would be wrong for emoji, flags, Hangul and Indic while *looking* like a guarantee, so it
  is deliberately not shipped. Same stance as Zig, and utf8everywhere points at ICU for it; baking the
  tables into `std` would also contradict targeting MCUs under `--no-heap`.
- **Stdlib layering — 3 LOW-prio follow-ups.** The prelude-vs-`std::`-vs-primitive split is principled and
  documented in [FLOOR.md](FLOOR.md) § "What is floor, and what is an `import`"; nothing is mis-placed. What
  is left, none of it blocking:
  - **`Atomic` needs no pthread but rides in `std::concurrent`**, which does — so lock-free-without-threads
    is unreachable. Split it to a `std::concurrent::atomic` leaf, or promote it as an always-available seam.
    Only matters once the multicore-MCU track starts (§5).
  - **`std::gpu` has no kama module.** The `kama_gpu.h` seam exists but programs `extern` the WebGPU C API
    raw; an idiomatic wrapper is library work on the engine track (§8).

  Decided NOT to add a convenience-import of the common containers — explicit per-symbol imports stay.
- **Format/interpolation follow-ups (on the shipped `std::fmt` substrate).** Interpolation, format specifiers,
  `@generate(Format)`, and tagged strings all ship (SPEC). Still open, additive, no current need: combining a
  base marker with width/flags (`${n:08x}`), a custom fill character, center-align (`^`); a `@generate(Format)`
  on a **generic**/**variant**/**enum** type; a `${x:?}`-routed `@generate(Debug)` (spec hook already exists);
  per-derive `@skip(Format)` / `@skip(Serialize)` for redaction (today `@skip` is one shared boolean —
  parameterize `FieldInfo::serSkip` to a per-derive set when a concrete case appears); and tagged-string
  *type-preserved params* (Model B — each hole keeping its static type into the params list, `html` returning
  a distinct `SafeHtml`). Regex is a separate campaign. `string + <number>` stays a compile error by design.
- **Full `expose` (2.0).** The minimal `expose fn` free-function C-ABI boundary ships today (SPEC + §8
  hot-reload); the **full `expose`** — richer wasm module exports + the scripting host interface — stays 2.0 (§7).
- **Derive follow-ons.** `@generate(Equatable, Hashable)` ships for plain types (SPEC § *Derives*). Still
  open, additive: the same derives on a **generic** or **variant** type (the same v1 boundary
  `@generate(Format)` draws — both error rather than half-deriving), and on a payload-less **enum**, which
  has no struct to walk and today takes a retroactive `implements` instead. A `Copyable` derive is a
  **non-goal**: a value/view copies by kind, and a resource's `copy` ctor is an ownership decision no field
  walk can make (a memberwise copy of a raw handle double-frees).
- **Unresolved type names — one residual: GENERIC ARGUMENTS.** Declared type names are now checked
  (`checkDeclaredTypes`, a single-visit walk at the tail of `collectProgram`), so a misspelled or unimported
  type in a parameter, return, field or variant payload is a kama-level error instead of a C-level
  `undeclared identifier` against generated code. What is still unchecked is a type name *inside* a generic
  argument — `DynamicArray<Bogos>` — because `checkTypeResolves` early-returns on `type->genericArg`.
  Recursing into `genericArgs` (as `addTypeRef` does in kama.query.cpp) is the natural phase 2, but it
  widens the surface onto const-generic size expressions, defaulted allocator args and bounds, so it wants
  its own sweep. Guarded today by `tests/xfail/unknown_type_{local,param,return,field,method_param,
  variant_payload}` + `unimported_type_param`, and by `tests/decl_type_check_guards.kama` for the three
  shapes the pass must NOT reject (a generic free fn's own params, `This`, a `sig` used before its file).
- **`kama check <file>` on a single member of a DIRECTORY module reports false errors.** Sibling units in the
  same namespace are not loaded for a bare single-file check, so `kama check lib/std/math/quat.kama` reports
  `Vec3`/`Mat4` as unknown — they live in `vec.kama`/`mat.kama` under the same `namespace std::math`. Harmless
  for the language server (it resolves the whole program from the manifest) and for any file reached through
  an import, but it makes single-file `check` unusable as a lint over a directory module, which is how the
  stdlib is laid out. Fix = widen a bare `check`'s unit set to the target's own namespace directory.
- **`std::net` — IPv6 and UDP multicast.** `IpAddr` has a `V4` arm only ([`lib/std/net/addr.kama`]), left
  deliberately as an `enum` so a `V6(...)` arm adds without reshaping `SocketAddr` or any call site.
  Multicast join/leave (`IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP`) is likewise unbuilt — broadcast covers LAN discovery today.
  Both are ordinary socket-option work on the shipped seam.
- **`char` has no `Format` / `Serialize` / `Deserialize` conformance (small, structural).** `char` and
  `uint32` share a C type, and the retro-conformance registry is keyed by cType, so it cannot hold both —
  `prelude/global.kama` records the `uint32` ones. String interpolation still renders a `char` AS A
  CHARACTER through a compiler fast path, but a `char` reaching those contracts through a GENERIC bound
  renders (and serializes) as its numeric scalar. Fix = key the registry by kama type rather than cType, or
  give `char` a distinct C typedef. The JSON backend now reads and writes `char` correctly either way.
- **Fallible `new` is concrete-only.** `try new` / `new(allocator:)` support concrete `Owned`/`Shared`;
  the type-erased interface-element handle (`Owned<Contract>`) and the stateful-allocator form report "not
  yet supported" (`emitFallibleNewBox`). A follow-on to the MCU step-5 allocator work.
- **Windows long-path support is deferred** (`kama_os.h`): the temp-path builder assumes `MAX_PATH`-class
  lengths. Surfaces only on a deep working directory.
- **UBSan's `function` check is disabled suite-wide** (`run_tests.sh`). Vtable / contract /
  `BindableFunctionPtr` dispatch stores each slot as `Ret (*)(void* self, …)` and calls a concrete
  `Ret C__m(C* self, …)` through it — ABI-identical, and how essentially all C OO dispatch works, but the
  check enforces exact function-pointer identity. Either emit a matching-signature trampoline or document
  the exemption as permanent; silently off is the wrong end state for 1.0.
- **Non-goal — function / constructor overloading.** Deliberately not planned: it conflicts with "one way to do
  a thing," and **named parameters** already cover the disambiguation overloading is usually reached for.
  **Operators are the sanctioned exception** — a type may carry several `operator*` distinguished by operand
  type (`mat*vec`, `mat*mat`), matching C++/C#/Rust. Reopen only if a concrete case shows named params can't
  express it.

## 3. Open design questions (settle before the work they gate)

- **Modular / opt-in stdlib — does "pay for what you use" pruning scale?** The **prelude mechanism**
  (`PRELUDE_SRC`) is the seed: a stdlib = more prelude-collected kama modules in a `Std` namespace. Generic
  types emit only when instantiated, and `--gc-sections` prunes unused functions in release. Open: whether that
  pruning suffices, or explicit per-module opt-in / dead-function elimination is warranted before a large stdlib
  grows. (`std::math`/`std::io` already ship as directory modules under this mechanism — the open question is
  whether pruning scales, not whether the packaging shape works.)
*(The `Slot<T>`/`MaybeUninit` spike that sat here is answered and shipped: the shape is a `slot`
DECLARATION, not a wrapper type — no new type, no `.assume_init()`, and an unassigned slot simply has no
drop emitted. See SPEC § *Uninitialized storage*.)*

## 4. Reflection + serialization — remaining follow-ups (1.x)

Serialization ships today (by-value + object-graph + polymorphic contracts) with **two backends — `json` (text)
and `binary` (KBIN)** — see [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) "Serialization". What remains is additive library + hardening:

- **Deserialize breadth** — `FixedArray<E>`/`InlineArray<T,N>` read; a bare `encode`/`decode` of an
  intrinsic/enum value; generic enums. (A `const` field is a separate general language gap — doesn't parse today.)
- **Binary backend follow-on (deferred).** `@bits(n)` bit-packing (tighter integers/bools), field-name
  interning, and a schema-locked *positional* mode (needs an emitter change; trades forward-compat for max
  compactness). Delta/snapshot replication stays ENGINE-level (above serde); generic byte compression is an
  io-adapter layer (§1 transform adapters), not a serde concern.
- **More back ends (library, no compiler change)** — YAML; **XML**/**HTML**. Each is a `Serializer`/`Deserializer`
  impl + `encode`/`decode`. `std::encoding::base64` is a separate small module.
- **`@deprecated` attribute (language, adjacent)** — a declaration marker (rides the `@`-attribute infra)
  emitting a use-site warning. Its own small task.
- **Optional/default *function/constructor* parameters (language, adjacent)** — the "options struct with
  optionals" ctor pattern. A deliberate non-goal for now: named static factories + named params cover it.
  (Distinct from **default *type* parameters**, which shipped.)

## 5. 1.x — systems & runtime (post-1.0)

Capabilities built on the finished language — the substrate the engine needs (asset I/O, scene serialization,
networking). The MCU/embedded language surface and the const-eval ladder are done ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md),
[MCU_READINESS.md](MCU_READINESS.md)). Remaining forward work:

- **Reflection + declarative serialization** — see §4; back ends follow as modules. Rides on the shipped
  `std::fs`/`std::io` for asset + scene load.
- **Container / data-structure reach — honest non-goals.** The core containers ship (`DynamicArray`/`FixedArray`/
  `InlineArray`/`string`, `Map`/`Set`, `Deque`, `PriorityQueue`, `SlotMap`, `BitSet`, `SortedMap`/`SortedSet`,
  `View<T>` — see SPEC). **Not** planned as stdlib: general **linked lists** (mostly a cache anti-pattern in
  data-oriented engines — the useful form is an intrusive free-list / LRU); raw **BSTs** (subsumed by the sorted
  map); **spatial trees** (quadtree/octree/BVH/k-d — engine-specific).
- **Collections revisit — remaining knobs & optimizations.** The parametric knobs ship (preallocation,
  pluggable `Hasher`, custom `Allocator` on every container and box, all defaulted). What remains:
  - **HashDoS-resistant keyed hashing (deferred).** `DefaultHasher` is deterministic/*unseeded* — right for
    trusted keys but NOT resistant to attacker-chosen keys. A seed at the `finish` stage can't fix this (it
    would leave string keys' unseeded FNV-1a content hash exposed). Real resistance needs a **seeded, keyed hash
    over the key bytes** (SipHash-class): the seed enters the per-byte accumulation + OS entropy + per-map seed
    storage. It **rides the pluggable `Hasher` seam non-breakingly**, so it's a clean future milestone — do NOT
    ship a finish-stage `SeededHasher` (misleading safety for the case that matters).
  - **Zero-size-field elision — deferred optimization.** The default `Owned<T>` carries a `GlobalAllocator alloc`
    field (mirroring the collections), which pads the handle. A general "drop any empty-struct field + synthesize
    a throwaway receiver for method calls on it" pass would reclaim it on `Owned` *and* every collection at once.
  - **Store-once allocator / thin smart-ptr handles — deferred optimization (Rust `Arc<T,A>` model).** The
    smart-pointer family carries `A` **per handle** (a small copyable value handle). The memory-optimal
    alternative stores the allocator **once** in a monomorphized control block and keeps handles thin. Not taken
    because `Owned` has no control block (can't unify), it would reopen the shipped concrete path, and the
    savings are small (the handle is already lightweight). Revisit as a whole-family refactor gated on profiling,
    bundled with the elision pass above.
- **Browser networking transports** — native TCP ships (`std::net`); the browser has no raw sockets, so the wasm
  path needs **WebRTC DataChannels** (unreliable) / **WebSockets** (reliable) via a host FFI shim. Native
  UDP/DNS and the rest of the stdlib reach are the §1 follow-ups.
- **Native dispatch devirtualization** *(optimization, not a gap).* On a *monomorphic* call site clang does not
  devirtualize the emitted C vtable while rustc does — a clang-vs-rustc optimizer gap (hand-written C is equally
  behind), not a kama defect. kama can win where it *sees* the concrete type by emitting a **direct call** — a
  laddered pass:
  - **Tier 1 — sound static devirtualization (no inlining).** Direct-call when the target is provable: a
    concrete-value receiver, a `final` class/method, or a method with no overrides program-wide (a slot→overridden
    map after `buildVtables()`). kama's whole-program view makes the last one free where C++ needs LTO +
    `-fwhole-program-vtables`. Land this first.
  - **Tier 2 — intraprocedural type-flow.** Devirtualize a base-typed local with a proven concrete assignment.
  - **Tier 3 — inlining-enabled / guarded devirtualization.** A kama-level inliner (hard part: integrating callee
    scope-cleanup / drop order / move-state with `emitScopeCleanup`) then re-run Tier 1, or guarded inline caches.
    A separate, larger project — pursue only if a real hot path (engine ECS dispatch) proves Tier 1 insufficient.

### Embedded / bare-metal MCU (Pi Pico · Arduino · ESP32) — toolchain packaging

The language surface is done ([MCU_READINESS.md](MCU_READINESS.md)); what remains is build and library work,
across two different targets:
- **Raspberry Pi (Linux — Pi 3/4/5, Zero):** a full ARM app processor running Linux, which kama already
  cross-compiles to. What is left is **GPIO/I²C/SPI bindings** — ordinary C FFI over `libgpiod` / `/dev/mem`.
- **Bare-metal MCU (Cortex-M: Pi Pico/RP2040 · Arduino Zero/Nano 33, ESP32; later AVR):** *freestanding* — no OS,
  KB of RAM, often no heap, a startup file + linker script instead of hosted libc:

  | Piece | What's needed |
  |---|---|
  | **Toolchain / build** | The turnkey Cortex-M path ships and is QEMU-proven ([mcu.md](mcu.md)). **Remaining:** more board presets (STM32/Pico), vendor-HAL glue (pico-sdk / esp-idf), a real-hardware flash pass, and (optional) folding the two-step link into `kama build --target <board>`. Arduino `setup()`/`loop()` is a later HAL nicety. |
  | **AVR (Harvard) family** *(deferred — Cortex-M/RISC-V first)* | Three AVR-specific pieces: (1) ISR — `@interrupt("VECTOR")` → the `ISR(VECTOR)` macro (`<avr/interrupt.h>`), not the parameterless `__attribute__((interrupt))`; (2) Harvard `PROGMEM` — flash const data needs `PROGMEM` + `pgm_read_*` accessors (a flash pointer can't be plain-deref'd), so `@section` alone doesn't cover it; (3) toolchain — `avr-gcc`-only (clang/zig don't target AVR cleanly). A bounded follow-on when demand warrants. |

  **Why kama fits:** no-GC + RAII → deterministic, no hidden pauses; allocation is explicit in the emitted C
  (greppable no-heap audit); trap lowering is dependency-free; `InlineArray<T,N>`, sized ints, and `unsafe`/`Ptr`
  FFI already exist. **North star: blink an LED** (the embedded "first triangle"). **Start Cortex-M, not AVR**
  (`zig cc`/clang do `thumbv*-none-eabi` cleanly; pico-sdk is tidy; AVR pain comes later).

### Compile-time evaluation & platform-specific compilation — residuals

The const-eval ladder and decl-level conditional compilation are done ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md)). What is left:

- **Host-endianness flag → `htole`/`htobe` (small).** `std::num` `byteswap*` (pure value swaps) + `bitcast`
  ship, but *host-order* serialization helpers need a compile-time endianness fact pure kama arithmetic can't
  observe — a natural `@compileFor`-style built-in flag (`LITTLE_ENDIAN`/`BIG_ENDIAN`). Every current target is
  little-endian, so this is deferred until a big-endian target appears.
- **`comptime fn` nice-to-haves (deferred).** `sizeof`/`alignof` and named-arg reorder *inside* a comptime fn
  body; a **local** `comptime T X = f();` initialized by a comptime-fn call (module + type-associated const
  forms ship); a per-fn `@steps(…)` budget override; dual-use fallback emission.
- **Platform tag-type compilation.** The `@compileFor`-gated contract-impl seam is the sanctioned platform-variance
  mechanism (per-platform `type` impls behind a platform-agnostic `contract`, exactly one survives) — NOT
  in-function branching / `#ifdef`. Extending it as new targets land is forward library/driver work.

## 6. Concurrency — what is left above the primitives

The language primitives are done ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md#concurrency-)). The higher-level **job system and
event-loop scheduler are libraries** on them (Go/Erlang-style block-on-channel, deliberately **not**
`async/await` function-colouring) — see the engine track (§8) and
[WEB_FRAMEWORK_READINESS.md](WEB_FRAMEWORK_READINESS.md).

- **Deferred (reopen only on a concrete case) — general shared-memory ("hybrid").** Co-equal shared-memory
  threading is *not* planned; it reintroduces the hazard the model removes. Capability is retained (via the
  `Atomic<T>` seam + immutable-`Shared` + disjoint `parallel_for`); only some ergonomics move behind the seam.

## 7. 2.0 — dual-mode: compiled + scripting/REPL (flagship)

**Sequenced AFTER the LSP** (§1 post-1.0 order; user, 2026-07-26). **Strictly additive — it never touches the
native/release C tier, which stays at C parity.** Direct-WASM is "another hot-reload/scripting option" (near-native,
toolchain-free) — *not* as fast as native kama today, so the C→emcc release path stays the max-perf web route.

**One language, two modes** — the *same static kama* (identical syntax, semantics, ownership rules; dynamic only
in *execution*, never in typing) usable both compiled and as a scripting language with a full REPL. The target is
a REPL that **replaces the Python/Ruby/Lua REPL** for fast iteration and compile-→-run-on-demand, at or near
native speed. Guiding constraint: **the `kama` binary is the only tool you need** — external C toolchains stay
*optional* (the portable-C release path), never required to write, run, or iterate.

**Two tiers, chosen by what dominates:**

| Tier | Path | Optimized for |
|---|---|---|
| **Release / AOT** | `kama → C → clang`/`emcc` | maximum runtime speed, the portability moat |
| **Iteration / scripting / REPL** | direct-wasm (+ `wasm-opt`), then a bytecode VM | compile speed, zero external toolchain, interactivity |

The release tier ships today and is untouched; the new work is the *iteration* tier, and it is **additive** —
never a replacement for C.

```

                          │
                   semantic lowering   (monomorphize, insert drops,
                          │             desugar vtables / match / operators)
          ┌───────────────┼────────────────────┐

    RELEASE — max    + wasm-opt             REPL, self-contained
    speed, moat      ITERATION / web        (IR extracted here, if ever)
```

Every backend shares the same front end, so the safety analysis is proven **once**, before lowering.

**Toolchain packaging rides along.** The version store is already modality-aware (`versions/<kind>-<v>/`,
`kind=compiler`), so once a scripting runtime exists it becomes the second `kind` — `kama toolchain` gains
runtime versions alongside compiler versions, resolved by the same project pin. Nothing to build until the
runtime does; it is only listed here so the store's spare axis isn't forgotten.

**Sequencing — polymorphic emitter first, a shared IR only when the VM forces it.** The emitter
(`kama.cemit.*`) *bakes in* the semantic lowering (monomorphization, RAII drop insertion, vtable layout,
match/operator desugaring). A "shared IR" is just that lowering **factored out** into a data structure the
backends consume — so *polymorphic emitter* and *shared IR* are the same idea at two points on a spectrum. The
pragmatic path:

1. **Refactor the emitter to an abstract interface**, C as the first implementation, the shared lowering in the
   base. Low risk.
2. **Add a direct-wasm backend** as a sibling — same lowering, different rendering. Drops the `emcc` dependency
   for self-contained web/scripting builds and proves the seam. (C→emcc still produces the maximal-compatibility
   release wasm.)
3. **Extract an explicit IR only when the VM needs it** — a bytecode VM is a genuinely different execution model,
   so re-deriving the lowering a *third* time is where a shared lowered form actually pays off. The VM becomes a
   low-drift renderer of the *same* lowered form the C backend uses.

**Design constraints (hold across the whole spectrum):**
- **Keep the lowered form high-level and structured** (retain `if`/`while`/`for` and named locals), *not*
  SSA/basic-blocks — so the C backend still emits the readable, `#line`-mapped C that is a headline feature.
- **Move the runtime into kama.** Collections/smart-pointers/`string` live as hand-tuned C in `kama_runtime.h`;
  a wasm or VM backend can't `#include` it. Finishing the port makes multi-backend and the
  kama-stdlib/self-hosting goal the **same** project — do it once, all backends inherit it.

**Direct-wasm optimization — lean on Binaryen, don't write an optimizer.** A naive direct `kama → wasm` backend
emits ~`-O0`/`-O1`-quality code. The fix is **`wasm-opt`** (Binaryen), a standalone optimizer that runs on *any*
wasm regardless of producer (the AssemblyScript model). `kama → wasm → wasm-opt -O3` recovers most of the gap. It
is **not** equal to `C→emcc -O3` (LLVM's mid-level IR optimizer + SIMD autovectorization stay ahead — heavy
numeric loops still favor the release tier), but buys **compile speed + zero dependency + a REPL** at
near-native runtime.

**Speed ladder** (fastest last): tree-walk < bytecode VM < direct-wasm/`wasm-opt` < AOT C→clang.

- **Licensing.** **Binaryen (`wasm-opt`) is Apache-2.0** — clean against the MIT goal (GOALS #8). A bundled
  **TinyCC**-JIT (near-instant native `kama run`) is a possible *optional* alternative but is **LGPL** — confirm
  linking terms before shipping it; the VM / direct-wasm paths sidestep it entirely.

## 8. Engine track (product north star)

A portable lightweight **WebGPU** game engine — a product built *on* kama, **not** part of the language. Tiers:
**math types** (shipped) → buffers/bindings → first triangle (shipped, browser + native, `examples/webgpu`) →
scene/material. Depends on the 1.x systems (file I/O for assets, serialization for scenes). The kama-scoped
remainder is at most a thin safe `std::gpu` binding wrapper over the shipped `kama_gpu.h` seam (optional stdlib
polish); the engine *spine* (buffer/pipeline/binding libraries, renderer) is the engine product. See
[ENGINE_READINESS.md](ENGINE_READINESS.md).

- **Dev-loop hot-reload — a *library* on two small compiler primitives that already ship.**
  - **Compiler primitives (ship — see SPEC *Exposing to a host*):** `kama build --shared` (`.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll`)
    and the `expose` keyword's C-ABI linkage are the *same* kama→host boundary the wasm exports and the scripting
    host (§7) use — so hot-reload needs **no new language surface**. One boundary, three consumers.
  - **Library:** the `dlopen`/`dlsym`/`dlclose` + file-watch + function-pointer rebind loop — pure FFI over
    `unsafe`/`Ptr`, zero compiler changes. This is the bulk of the feature. (A Windows copy-before-load, so the
    on-disk `.dll` can be rebuilt while loaded, is a library concern.)
  - **Engine:** the *data-in-host, code-in-module* architecture (world state lives in the platform-layer arena,
    passed *into* the reloaded module) so a reload doesn't wipe the world. Prior art: Handmade Hero, Our
    Machinery, Unreal Live++, Godot GDExtension, Bevy `hot_lib_reloader`.
  - **Scope — desktop dev only.** dlopen is absent/forbidden on ship targets (no wasm dlopen; banned on iOS;
    Android/Quest only via a pushed `.so`). Cross-platform *shipping* scripting is the §7 VM, not this. This buys
    fast native iteration on Linux/Mac/Windows — enough to justify the two tiny primitives.

## 9. Performance

Where kama currently stands is measured in [benchmarks/RESULTS.md](benchmarks/RESULTS.md) — read it there
rather than here, so there is one number to keep current. Forward work:

- **Bench methodology (don't re-chase).** Measure wasm at the optimizing tier (`node --no-liftoff`). Short
  workloads skew under parallel load — run with nothing else competing. Keep all LLVM-AOT languages at the same
  `-O` level (`-O3`), or the optimization level dominates a tiny kernel.
- **Bench cohort — add Zig.** kama's closest *language* rival (no-GC, AOT, and, as `zig cc`, already kama's
  bundled backend). Port the workloads to `.zig`, add the toolchain. Expect it to cluster with C/Rust on raw
  compute — the signal is the *compile-time / binary-size / RSS* columns and cohort completeness, not the perf
  ranking.
- **Serialization benchmark track.** A headline feature — add a round-trip workload, scoped honestly (it measures
  *library maturity + reflection-vs-compile-time strategy*, a different axis than the compute kernels). Only 6 of
  11 bench languages have stdlib JSON. **v1:** a by-value tree round-trip across the stdlib-JSON six —
  *intrinsic (kama)* vs *runtime-reflection (Go/C#)* vs *interpreted (Python/JS)*. **Document, don't race, the
  object graph** (kama's shared/`Weak`/`Owned` graph serde has no equivalent — a capability note, not a number).
## 10. Tooling / distribution (deferred)

- **Build configuration + cross-compilation — residuals.** The target/build-type/output selection model is
  done ([targets.md](targets.md), [SPEC.md](SPEC.md)). What is left:
  - **⚠️ No CPU-tuning knob.** kama passes **no** `-march`/`-mcpu`/`-mtune` anywhere, so every build targets
    the architecture's *generic baseline*. That is the right default (portable binaries — and it is why
    `zig cc` and clang measure identical, neither tunes), but there is no first-class way to say otherwise:
    the only route today is `"cflags": ["-mcpu=…"]` on a declared `select.TARGET` entry, so **a plain
    `kama build --release` cannot tune for the host at all**. Every peer has a shorthand (Rust
    `-C target-cpu=native`, Zig `-mcpu=native`, gcc/clang `-march=native`). Likely shape: a `cpu` field on a
    target spec, plus a `native` spelling for host builds. Wants a before/after benchmark first — kama's
    emitted C is fairly generic, so the win may be small outside float/SIMD-heavy code.
  - **Per-value `BUILD_TYPE` settings** (own opt-level/LTO/strip), deliberately deferred so `kama.json` does
    not become a build-settings language; and **numeric build options surfaced as `comptime` constants**
    rather than as flag comparisons (`@compileFor` stays tagging, not logic).
- **VS Code Marketplace publish** — the `.vsix` is built and attached to releases; Marketplace publishing is
  deferred, and gates on a public release.
- **Language server (LSP) — residuals.** `kama lsp` and its eight editors are documented in
  [editors.md](editors.md). Forward work:
  - **Tree-sitter grammar + Zed extension — residuals.** `tree-sitter-kama/` is guarded by
    `tools/check-treesitter.sh`; `editor/zed/` is the Zed extension. Forward work:
    - **Flip the grammar source to the public URL** when the repo goes public — a tag `rev` +
      `https://github.com/cosmic-canopy/kama` in `editor/zed/extension.toml`, and the `git`+`subpath` form
      in the Helix snippet. Both spellings are already written out in `docs/editors.md`; this is a
      two-line change gated purely on visibility.
    - **Close the Zed loop.** The Rust component is compile-verified against `zed_extension_api` and the
      queries are checked, but `zed: install dev extension` is a GUI action and has not been run.
    - **Registry/ecosystem registrations, all gated on the repo being public:** publish to the Zed
      extension registry; nvim-treesitter `install_info` with `location = 'tree-sitter-kama'`; the GitHub
      linguist PR (`provisioning/linguist/languages.yml.snippet` still points at the TextMate grammar);
      and upstreaming the Helix `[[language]]`/`[[grammar]]` entries — the same class of work as the
      `nvim-lspconfig`/`eglot-server-programs` registrations below.
  - **The ~10 ms fixed prelude-ANALYSIS floor per keystroke.** M5 removed the prelude *parse* from every
    keystroke; analyzing it again on every buffer change is what remains, and it is a floor no file can get
    under. The fix is a pre-baked or forkable `CEmitter` — a real piece of work, not a tweak.
  - **One build configuration per server process.** It is pinned by the first opened document that resolves
    a manifest, so in a monorepo whose packages declare *different* flag universes the unpinned packages get
    the pinned one's configuration. Softened, not fixed: the status bar says which is active and
    `kama.restartServer` exists. The real fix needs **per-configuration parse caches**, because
    `pruneInactiveDecls` rewrites cached units in place.
  - **Upstream editor registration** — a `kama` entry in `nvim-lspconfig`, in Helix's built-in
    `languages.toml` and in `eglot-server-programs`. Turns six pasted lines into zero for users, but these
    are PRs to *other* projects and gate on a public release.
  - **Three editor snippets are documented but unverified** — Vim (coc.nvim), Sublime Text and Kate. Each
    needs a human at a GUI; Sublime additionally needs its LSP package installed through Package Control.
- **Workspace-internal dependencies — one follow-on.** Workspaces work today ([packages.md](packages.md)).
  What is left: version reconciliation on publish — `kama publish` substituting a registry version for a
  workspace path dep.
- **kama-aware debugger value formatting — polish on the working debugger.** Breakpoints/stepping are already
  kama-source-level, but inspected values render in their emitted-C form (a `string` shows as
  `kama_string {data,len,cap}`, `Optional<T>` as its tagged union, collections as C structs). Add LLDB type
  summaries / synthetic providers (CodeLLDB supports Python formatters) so `string`/`Optional`/`Result`/the
  collections/smart-pointers render as kama values. Small next to the LSP, high polish-value, builds directly
  on the shipped debug flow.
- **Browser-debug ergonomics** — richer wasm source maps / a no-extension flow.
- **Package manager (ecosystem foundation).** A first-class dependency manager + registry so libraries distribute
  without vendoring — the point at which the **orphan rule** (§3, retroactive conformance) becomes load-bearing.
  User docs (including the registry protocol a host must serve): [packages.md](packages.md). What remains is
  hosted-services and ops work:
  - **Both gated on hosted services / the repo being public + the website staged:**
    - **M3.3 — hosted deployment (pure ops, no compiler change).** Stand up the real registry host (Cloudflare
      Pages static index + GitHub Releases/R2 tarballs), wire the built-in default base URI (`kDefaultRegistry`,
      deliberately **empty** today so an unconfigured registry dep errors rather than reaching a dead URL) to the
      live URL, add publish auth (a token model — the one M3.1/M3.2a open question left for the remote), and
      extend a PUBLISHING.md release process. A dynamic Workers/KV/R2-or-Node service is an *optional* drop-in
      speaking the same M3.1 protocol.
    - **Mandatory verification + the trust model.** Signing ships but proves less than it looks like:
      `ssh-keygen -Y check-novalidate` validates the signature against *the key inside the signature*, so
      **nothing binds that key to a publisher** — and verification runs only on a cold url fetch (a warm
      store hit and every git dep are unchecked). [packages.md](packages.md) now says so plainly; content
      integrity (tree-hash store keys, pinned `integrity`, the confusion guard) is the guarantee that
      actually carries weight today.

      **Decided direction:** follow where the ecosystem landed rather than per-developer signing keys.
      Go ships no package signatures at all and leans on the `sum.golang.org` transparency log; PyPI
      *removed* PGP in 2023 (almost nobody verified) and replaced it with OIDC Trusted Publishing +
      attestations; npm did the same via sigstore provenance; crates.io ships checksums only. So:
      **(a)** near-term, an allowed-signers set — real `ssh-keygen -Y verify` against a configured trust
      set, plus closing the warm-store and git-dep gaps; **(b)** then CI/OIDC provenance recorded in a
      transparency log, at which point verification becomes mandatory. Both gate on a live registry, since
      mandatory verification is meaningless before one exists.
- **Longer-term — a "node.js-class" application framework in kama.** A fast, low-overhead server/app framework
  (HTTP already dogfooded via `examples/httpd`), aiming to beat the Node/Deno overhead profile on the no-GC/AOT
  (or VM-scripted) runtime — the flagship *application* of the language + package manager + scripting tiers
  together. See [WEB_FRAMEWORK_READINESS.md](WEB_FRAMEWORK_READINESS.md). Aspirational, post-ecosystem.
